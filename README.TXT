This one is me learning the prerequisites of data science and machine learning
I think I will learn numpy, pandan, scipy and matplotlib here
Venv has all the things needed based on python3.6

Contents

PART I - NUMPY TRIALS
1. numpyArrayVersusList : Differences between a numpy array and built in lists like append, concat using + etc
2. dotProducts : How to do dot product using for loop and the more efficient np.dot(), also contains np.norm() and cos inverse using np.arccos()
3. vectorsAndMatrices : Working with 2d numpy arrays and built in numpy matrices (which is discouraged)
4. generatingMatrices : Generating zero, one and random matrices to work with without using for loop
5. matrixOperations : Inverse, Determinant, Eigen values and vectors, Diagonal elements, generating Diagonal matrices and identity matrices.
6. solvingALinearSystem : Solve a system of n linear equations in n variables using numpy.linalg,solve()

PART II - PANDAS TRIALS
7. manualDataLoading : Loading data using a for loop without using pandas.
8. dataFrameLoadingData : Automatic Loading of data and manipulation using pd.read_csv()
9. moreOnDataFrames : df.apply(), Renaming column, printing a single column, adding column of ones, adding a column having derived value using apply()
10. joins : joining two df using pandas.merge(df1, df2, on="attribute_name")
