This one is me learning the prerequisites of data science and machine learning
I think I will learn numpy, pandan, scipy and matplotlib here
Venv has all the things needed based on python3.6

Contents
1. numpyArrayVersusList : Differences between a numpy array and built in lists like append, concat using + etc
2. dotProducts : How to do dot product using for loop and the more efficient np.dot(), also contains np.norm() and cos inverse using np.arccos()
3. vectorsAndMatrices : Working with 2d numpy arrays and built in numpy matrices (which is discouraged)
4. generatingMatrices : Generating zero, one and random matrices to work with without using for loop
5. matrixOperations : Inverse, Determinant, Eigen values and vectors, Diagonal elements, generating Diagonal matrices and identity matrices.
6. solvingALinearSystem : Solve a system of n linear equations in n variables using numpy.linalg,solve()
